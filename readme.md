| `proxy` | Traefik, Django | Public-facing routing |
| `internal` | PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery | Backend only, never reachable from outside |

## ✨ Features

### Wallet & Payments
- Wallet funding via aghayepardakht payment gateway
- Peer-to-peer transfers with PIN verification and KYC check
- Atomic transactions using `select_for_update()` to prevent race conditions
- Full transaction history

### Savings Goals
- Create goals with target amount and target date
- Deposit/withdraw funds between wallet and goals
- Progress tracking with percentage calculation

### Security
- KYC verification required before any transfer
- Transaction PIN on all outgoing transfers
- Beneficiary management with whitelist support

### Async Processing (Celery + Redis)
- All notifications created asynchronously — HTTP responses never wait for DB writes
- Deposit and transfer confirmation emails sent in background
- Daily wallet summary digest via Celery Beat (runs every day at 08:00)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff on task failure

### Caching (Redis)
| Endpoint | Cache TTL | Invalidation trigger |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| `GET /api/overview/` | 2 minutes | Any wallet/goal change |
| `GET /api/savings/` | 5 minutes | Goal create/deposit/withdraw |
| `GET /api/beneficiaries/` | 10 minutes | Beneficiary add/delete |

## ⚙️ Key Engineering Decisions

**Atomic transfers with `select_for_update()`**
Both wallets are locked inside a single `transaction.atomic()` block before any balance change. This prevents double-spending if two transfers happen simultaneously.

**Notifications outside the atomic block**
Celery tasks are dispatched *after* `transaction.atomic()` commits. If they were inside the block, a task could read an uncommitted DB state and create a notification for a transfer that later rolled back.

**Cache invalidation strategy**
Rather than per-field invalidation, the entire user cache namespace is dropped on any mutation. Simple, correct, and fast enough for this scale.

**Two Docker networks**
PostgreSQL and Redis are on the `internal` network only. Even if Traefik were misconfigured, the database is unreachable from outside.
